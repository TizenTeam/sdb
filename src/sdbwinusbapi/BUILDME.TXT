In order to build SdbWinUsbApi.dll you will need to install Windows Driver Kit,
which can be obtained from Microsoft. Assuming that WDK is installed, you
need to set one of the WDK's build environments, "cd" back into this directory,
and execute "build -cbeEIFZ" to clean and rebuild this project, or you can
execute "build -befEIF" to do a minimal build.
Note that you need to build SdbWinApi.dll (..\api) before you build
SdbWinUsbApi.dll, as it depends on SdbWinApi.lib library.
